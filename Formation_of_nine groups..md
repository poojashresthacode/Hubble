# Calculation of the Age of the Universe by using the Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae from the 1929 Hubble Paper.
Hubble's law is basically proof that the universe is expanding. The law can be expressed with the equation:

v = H₀d

where:
"v" represents the recessional velocity of a galaxy.
"d" represents the distance of the galaxy from Earth.
"H₀" is the Hubble constant, which is a measure of the current rate of the universe's expansion.

## Formation of nine groups for twenty-four nebulas:
The main task for our work is to get an idea of how these twenty-four nebulas are grouped to form nine groups of open circles as seen in the Hubble paper. For this, first of all, I inserted the NG number for the nebulae in the galaxy catalogue(http://spider.seds.org/ngc/ngc.html) 
I reported the distance, brightness, dimension and constellation in which these nebulae lies. I was unable to find the information for S.Mag. and L.Mag. They are small and large Magellanic cloud.
I was short of information for these two objects and that's why I wasnot able to form the group by this method.

So, I manually looked up the graph of Hubble's paper and calculated the distance from the graph observing the 9 open circle points.
